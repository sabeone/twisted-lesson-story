### The Storyworld
Plot: The City of Astúron has been dealing with rising tensions over the past 10 years in response to a royal decree that banned nearly all magic in the city. As the city prepares to host its 10th annual non magical fighting tournament, all manner of people flock to see the spectacle. Little do they know that this tournament will lead to the kidnapping of a young (but more importantly, unauthorized) magic user working for the Royal Court. This inciting incident sets off a chain of events that will force the city’s members to reconsider what is best for themselves and their nation.
